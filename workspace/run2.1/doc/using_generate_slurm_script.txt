A typical invocation looks like this (reformatted for clarity):

@cori01> python generate_slurm_script.py
    --candidate_file data/master_obshistid_list.txt
    --n_obs 100000 --d_obs 56 --n_jobs 14
    --min_obs 1235518 --max_obs 1476730
    --out_dir /global/cscratch1/sd/descim/instcat_y06_191125
    --config_file_name config_file_2.1.wfd.json
N already done 0
writing  slurm_scripts/batch_script_0.sl


This is to generate a file for year 6.
The value for --n-obs is intended to be large enough that it will not
limit the visits handled.
Those visits will be the ones in the candidate file where
   min_obs < visitid <= max_obs

After the script is generated it will need to be edited somewhat and
you may want to rename it.  The generated names are of the form
  batch_script_N.sl
 where N is the least non-negative integer such that this file doesn't
 already exist.

Items to change or consider changing within the file are

1. Add line
#SBATCH --job-name=[something informative]

2. Modify values for -o and -e SBATCH options
3. (Maybe) change value for -q  option (default is 'regular')
4. (Maybe) change value for -t option
