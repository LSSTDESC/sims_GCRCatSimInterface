The general workflow for generating a Truth Catalog is as follows:

1) run generate_truth_params.py
2) run add_sne.py
3) run generate_truth_static.py
4) run generate_truth_lc.py

Step (1) will query the extragalactic catalog and write out an intermediate
sqlite file that contains all of the parameters needed to simulate photometry
for the objects in the specified area of the sky.  This step is necessary
because of the way the sprinkler works.  The sprinkler acts during
InstanceCatalog generation, intervening to replace objects that are listed in
the extragalactic catalog with strongly-lensed systems.  The only way to
correctly replace proto/cosmoDC2 systems with their sprinkled counterparts is to
run the InstanceCatalog pipeline code which step (1) does.

Step (2) adds parameters for unsprinkled supernovae to the database produced by
step (1).  This is a separate step because the way we stored unsprinkled
supernovae in the protoDC2 runs differs from the way we are ultimately storing
them for the full cosmoDC2 runs, and I did not want to overthink how the system
would work while generating truth catalogs for Run1.2.  Note: if you run step
(2) twice on the same database, the unsprinkled supernovae will be added twice.

Step (3) reads in the static object parameters from the database created in
step (1) and creates a sqlite database with a table `truth` that contains the
columns
    healpix_2048 (that resolution should probably be changed)
    object_id (this maps to galaxy_id in the extragalactic catalog)
    star (== 1 if the object is a star)
    agn (== 1 if the galaxy contains an AGN)
    sprinkled (== 1 if the object was added by the sprinkler)
    ra (in degrees)
    dec (in degrees)
    redshift (cosmological only)
    u, g, r, i, z, y ( all observed; no dust extinction)

Step (4) reads in the variable and transient parameters from the database
created in step (1) and creates a sqlite database with several tables.

    light_curves with columns
        - uniqueId -- an int unique to all objects
        - obshistid -- an int unique to all pointings
        - mag -- the magnitude observed for this object at that pointing

    obs_metadata with columns
        - obshistid -- an int unique to all pointings
        - mjd -- the date of the pointing
        - filter -- an int corresponding to the telescope filter (0==u, 1==g..)

    variables_and_transients with columns
        - uniqueId -- an int unique to all objects
        - galaxy_id -- an int indicating the host galaxy
        - ra -- in degrees
        - dec -- in degrees
        - agn -- ==1 if object is an AGN
        - sn -- ==1 if object is a supernova
