    """
    This is a class for taking several DESCQAObject daughter classes that
    query the same catalog for the same rows (but different
    columns), and combining their queries into one.

    You feed the constructor a list of DESCQAObject daughter classes.  The
    CompoundDESCQAObject verifies that they all do, indeed, query the same
    catalog.  It then constructs its own self.columns member (note
    that CompoundDESCQAObject is a daughter class of DESQAObject) which
    combines all of the requested data.

    When you call query_columns, a recarray will be returned as in a DESCQAObject.
    Note, however, that the names of the columns of the recarray will be modified.
    If the first DESCQAObject class in the list of DESCQAObject classes passed to the
    constructor asks for a column named 'col1', that will be mapped to 'catName_col1'
    where 'catName' is the DESCQAObject's objid member.  'col2' will be mapped to
    'catName_col2', etc.  In cases where the DESCQAObject does not change the name
    of the column, the column will also be returned by its original, un-mangled name.
